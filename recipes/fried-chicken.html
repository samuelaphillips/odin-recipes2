        <h2>A delicious southern classic why does it taste so good?</h2>
        <p>
            There are a few reasons this crispy fried chicken works so well:

            Allowing the buttermilk-flour mixture to come to a paste-like consistency is key to a crispiness on the outside and juiciness on the inside.
            Most fried chicken is cooked at a high temperature throughout the frying process. This one, however, only starts at a very high heat â€” after browning, the heat is reduced for about 30 minutes. You'll turn up the temperature again at the end, locking in that crispy texture.
            Paprika adds smoky flavor and has a low smoke point, which helps with browning the chicken.
